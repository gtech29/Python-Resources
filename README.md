# Welcome to My Resources Repository

This space serves as a collection of resources I’ve gathered throughout my journey in coding.  
My goal is to share materials and insights that may help you:

- Get started in programming  
- Avoid common mistakes I’ve made  
- Grow into a stronger developer  

Feel free to explore the repository and use whatever is useful to you.  
If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, I’d be more than happy to connect.  

I hope you find value here, and I wish you the best on your coding journey!
